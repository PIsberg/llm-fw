# Token savings

The firewall already sits on every LLM request, so it can also make requests
cheaper before they leave. Each technique below is a separate gateway module
with its own switch, its own KPIs on the dashboard's **Modules** tab, and its
own live events. All of them are off by default, because each one changes what
the provider receives.

## Turning a module on and off

Every module has a `modules.<key>.enabled` config key. Each can be flipped live,
without a restart, in any of these ways:

- the toggle on its card in the dashboard's **Modules** tab, which also
  persists the change to `~/.llm-fw/config.json`,
- `POST /api/modules` with `{"id": "<module id>", "enabled": true}`,
- editing `config.json`, which is hot-reloaded,
- the `LLM_FW_*_ENABLED` environment variable, at start-up.

`modules.enabled: false` (or `LLM_FW_MODULES_ENABLED=false`) turns off the
whole pipeline.

## What every module guarantees

- **It runs before DLP and detection**, on the proxy and on the gateway, so
  both scan the body that is actually forwarded. Text a module removes never
  reaches the model, so it cannot carry an injection either.
- **It fails open.** A module that throws is logged and skipped, and the
  request continues with the body as the previous module left it.
- **Observe mode is a dry run.** The module runs and its card counts what it
  would have saved, but the original body is forwarded.
- **The same history comes out byte-identical on every turn.** A rewrite
  depends only on the text it rewrites and on what comes before it in the
  request, never on time or on how long the conversation is. Two things depend
  on that: the provider's prompt cache, which matches on the exact prefix,
  and, on models with preserved thinking (Claude Fable 5.1, Opus 5.5, Sonnet
  5.5, Haiku 5.5), the signature on every thinking block, which records the
  conversation before it.

### Changing a module in the middle of a conversation

Turning a rewriting module on or off, or changing one of its options, changes
how the earlier turns of a running conversation are sent. The next request
misses the prompt cache once. On models with preserved thinking, accounts the
provider enforces the check for (Anthropic accounts created on or after
2026-08-31) get a 400 for that conversation: "The block is bound to a different
conversation." Start a new conversation after changing a module, or change
modules between sessions.

## How savings are counted

Each card counts tokens over the text the module examined, before and after,
never over the request body: re-serialising a pretty-printed JSON envelope
shrinks the body by bytes the model never sees.

The count is an estimate, made without a tokenizer dependency
(`src/modules/tokens.ts`). It cuts text the way a BPE pre-tokenizer does, so a
run of spaces counts as one token however long it is. Against the public
cl100k and o200k tokenizers its mean error is 4 to 8% on prose, code, JSON,
prompts and tool output, and 28% on base64. The 4-characters-per-token rule
it replaced overstated what collapsing whitespace saves on column-aligned
tool output by 75%. Claude's tokenizer is not public, so treat the numbers as
an approximation of any provider's bill.

## Modules

In pipeline order, which is also the order of the cards:

| Module id | Config key | Rewrites |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ansi-strip` | `modules.ansiStrip` | terminal escape codes in tool output and prompts |
| `progress-collapse` | `modules.progressCollapse` | progress-bar frames in tool output and prompts |
| `repeat-collapse` | `modules.repeatCollapse` | runs of identical lines in tool output |
| `blob-elide` | `modules.blobElide` | long base64 and hex runs in tool output |
| `token-pruner` | `modules.tokenPruner` | prompt and system text |
| `tool-result-pruner` | `modules.toolResultPruner` | tool output |
| `tool-result-dedup` | `modules.toolResultDedup` | repeated tool output |
| `tool-definition-pruner` | `modules.toolDefinitionPruner` | tool and parameter descriptions |
| `usage-meter` | `modules.usageMeter` | nothing; reads responses (on by default) |

### Tool result pruner

`modules.toolResultPruner.enabled` (`LLM_FW_TOOL_RESULT_PRUNER_ENABLED`).
Tool output (Anthropic `tool_result` blocks, OpenAI `tool` messages, Responses
API `function_call_output`) is usually most of an agent's input. Three
techniques, each with its own switch:

| Option | Default | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `minifyJson` | `true` | A tool result that is a JSON object or array loses the whitespace outside its strings. Lexical, not parse-and-print: every number and string stays byte for byte, so `12345678901234567890` is not rounded. |
| `trimTrailing` | `true` | Spaces and tabs at the end of each line go. |
| `collapseSpaceRuns` | `false` | Runs of two or more spaces after a line's indentation become one. Saves the most on column-aligned command output (`ls -l`, `kubectl get`, `docker ps`). |

What to watch for: an agent quotes a file read verbatim in its next edit. With
`trimTrailing`, an edit whose quoted text spans a line that ends in spaces in
the file no longer matches. With `collapseSpaceRuns`, any edit of a line with
aligned spaces misses, which is why it is off. A single tab, such as the one
after a line number in Claude Code's file reads, is never collapsed.

### Tool result deduplicator

`modules.toolResultDedup.enabled` (`LLM_FW_TOOL_RESULT_DEDUP_ENABLED`), option
`minLength` (default `200` characters). Agents reread the same file and rerun
the same command, and every copy stays in the history they resend. A tool
result identical to an earlier one in the same request becomes
`[llm-fw: identical to the earlier tool result <id>]`, naming the first copy
by its tool call id (or `#n`, its position, when the format carries no id).
The first copy always stays, and which copy is kept depends only on what came
before it, so a growing conversation is rewritten the same way on every turn.

### Tool definition pruner

`modules.toolDefinitionPruner.enabled` (`LLM_FW_TOOL_DEFINITION_PRUNER_ENABLED`).
An agent sends its whole tool list, descriptions included, on every request.
This applies the token pruner's rules to each tool's `description` and to
every `description` inside its parameter schema, in the Anthropic, OpenAI chat,
Responses API and Gemini shapes. Tool names, enum values and schema structure
are never touched, because they are the contract with the tool. The tool list
sits at the very front of the cached prefix, so this costs one cache miss when
it is switched, and nothing after.

### Usage meter

`modules.usageMeter.enabled` (`LLM_FW_USAGE_METER_ENABLED`), **on by
default**, because it reads responses and changes nothing. It adds up the token
counts the provider reports in each response, so the estimates on the other
cards can be checked against the bill:

- **Uncached input**: input billed at the full rate,
- **Cache reads** and **cache writes**: the prompt-cache traffic that decides
  what a long agent session costs,
- **Output**,
- **Input served from cache**: cache reads over all input.

It reads Anthropic `usage` (JSON and the `message_start` / `message_delta`
stream events), OpenAI chat `usage` (a stream carries it only when the client
sends `stream_options.include_usage`), the Responses API `response.completed`
event, and Gemini `usageMetadata`. A response larger than `proxy.maxBodyBytes`
is not metered, so a large download is never held in memory twice.

### ANSI escape stripper

`modules.ansiStrip.enabled` (`LLM_FW_ANSI_STRIP_ENABLED`). Removes terminal
escape sequences from tool output and user prompts: colour and style codes
from test runners and linters, cursor movement and line erasure, window
titles, and OSC 8 hyperlinks (the link text stays). A coloured test summary
spends several tokens per escape on text the model cannot see. Nothing
printable is removed.

### Progress bar collapser

`modules.progressCollapse.enabled` (`LLM_FW_PROGRESS_COLLAPSE_ENABLED`). A
progress bar or spinner captured from a terminal (npm, pip, docker pull, curl)
arrives as every frame it drew, separated by bare carriage returns. Each line
keeps only its last frame with text, which is all the terminal ever showed. A
carriage return that ends a CRLF line is a line ending and stays.

### Repeated line collapser

`modules.repeatCollapse.enabled` (`LLM_FW_REPEAT_COLLAPSE_ENABLED`), option
`minRun` (default `3`, at least `2`). A run of `minRun` or more identical lines
in tool output (a retry loop, a warning per file, a polling script) becomes
its first line followed by `[llm-fw: previous line repeated N more times]`.
Lines compare exactly, whitespace included; blank lines are left to the
whitespace pruners. Tool output only, because a user who pastes a line five
times may mean it. An agent that reads a data file with repeated lines sees
the marker instead of the lines, so an edit that quotes the run would miss.

### Blob elider

`modules.blobElide.enabled` (`LLM_FW_BLOB_ELIDE_ENABLED`), option `minLength`
(default `2048` characters, at least `64`). A run of base64, base64url or hex
characters in tool output that is at least `minLength` long and holds both a
digit and a letter (an image embedded in an API response, a certificate, a
source map) becomes `[llm-fw: N-character base64 blob elided, sha256
1a2b3c4d]`. The hash keeps two different blobs distinguishable and the same
blob reading the same on every turn. A `data:...;base64,` prefix stays, and so
does the JSON around a blob, since the marker holds no quote or backslash.
Tool output only: a user who pastes base64 into a prompt may want it decoded.
An agent that reads a file holding a blob and then rewrites the whole file
would write the marker, so leave it off for agents that edit such files.

### Token pruner

`modules.tokenPruner.enabled` (`LLM_FW_TOKEN_PRUNER_ENABLED`). Collapses
interior runs of spaces and tabs to one space, runs of blank lines to one, and
trailing whitespace, and minifies multiline JSON embedded in the text, keeping
every number and string byte for byte. Leading indentation and fenced code are
kept.

It rewrites user, assistant and system text in OpenAI chat, the OpenAI
Responses API (`input`, `instructions`), Anthropic (`messages`, `system`) and
Gemini (`contents`, `systemInstruction`). It never touches tool output: an
agent quotes a file read verbatim in its next edit, so a collapsed run of
spaces there makes the edit miss. It never touches thinking blocks either.

An unfenced string literal with aligned spaces is altered, which is why it is
opt-in.
