## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-09

Initial release.

### Added

**Interception & transport**
- HTTP `HTTPS_PROXY` mode (no admin) and OS-level sinkhole mode (hosts file + `:443` redirect).
- Local TLS termination with a per-host SAN cert factory backed by a local root CA (key stored `0700` in `~/.llm-fw`); streaming request inspection with early `403` abort and zero-copy forwarding for safe traffic.
- Built-in provider registry covering OpenAI/Azure, Anthropic, Gemini/Vertex, Mistral, Groq, OpenRouter, Together, Fireworks, DeepSeek, xAI, Perplexity, Cohere, Anyscale, and HuggingFace; native parsing of any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- Standalone server mode (`--standalone`) to share one firewall across machines, with CA download endpoints.

**Detection pipeline**
- Stage 1 heuristic scoring with evasion normalization (Unicode NFKC, homoglyph/leetspeak folding, base64/hex/binary/morse/caesar/rot13/pig-latin/reversed decoders, entropy gating).
- Stage 2 embedding cosine similarity against a known-attack corpus using a local ONNX model with sliding-window chunking.
- Stage 3 optional local Ollama judge (async-monitor by default; sync-block and judge-unless-benign policies).
- Indirect-injection coverage: tool results, tool definitions (poisoning), and RAG context-poisoning (structural + judge signals).
- ASCII smuggling detection — invisible Unicode Tags, bidi overrides, and plane-14 variation selectors are decoded and blocked.

**Other defenses**
- Data Loss Prevention (cloud keys, tokens, private keys, cards, PII) with block/redact/audit modes.
- DoS / cost-control circuit breakers: per-minute rate limit, rolling token budget, identical-request loop detection.
- MCP tool firewall: allow/deny policy plus execution-context command guardrails (categories A–D) over request and streamed/buffered responses.
- Outbound URL/exfiltration filter (known sinks, DGA/high-entropy hosts, data-carrying query strings).
- Cross-turn taint tracking (audit/block) of untrusted tokens reused in outbound destinations.
- Response-side exfil detection — markdown/HTML image & link URLs in model responses, audited or neutralized; works on gzip/brotli/deflate-compressed responses.

**Dashboard** (`localhost:7731`)
- Events feed with expandable detail drawer and false-positive whitelisting.
- Prompt Testing playground across every detector, with a Google-Translate control for multilingual probing.
- Live Traffic throughput chart, per-service utilization, and connection log.
- Settings tab to enable/disable each defense live (no restart), persisted to `~/.llm-fw/config.json`.
- Token authentication required for non-loopback access (auto-generated when bound remotely); CSRF guard on state-changing endpoints.

**Tooling & quality**
- CLI: `setup`, `setup-judge`, `start`, `stop`, `status`, `doctor`, `uninstall`; IDE proxy auto-configuration and reversible env-var persistence.
- Test suite: unit, integration, Playwright e2e, and load (performance + accuracy) tests; a deterministic detection-accuracy regression gate (precision/recall with per-category floors) run in CI.
- Distribution: npm publish workflow (publishes with provenance on a GitHub Release).
